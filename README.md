# shecodes-workshop-1

The code in this repo is work I did in my first SheCodes workshop. In here you'll find lesson challenges, homework, and even final project code. This workshop was 3 weeks but I finished a bit early. It was a super fun workshop on intro to coding! :computer:

## npm install http-server -g
After installing we can go to our static site directory and can run

## http-server
It will serve the directory on localhost 8080 by default.
